> An integrated, AI-driven platform for end-to-end metagenomics analysis.

MetagenomicsOS is a comprehensive, scalable, and extensible platform designed to streamline metagenomics analysis from raw sequencing data to actionable insights. It integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools, AI-powered analytics, and robust workflow orchestration to support research in complex microbial communities.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages machine learning models for advanced tasks like taxonomic classification, functional prediction, and anomaly detection.
*   **End-to-End Workflow Orchestration:** Uses Snakemake to manage complex, multi-step analysis pipelines, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Ingests and processes data from streaming sources for continuous analysis and monitoring.
*   **Multi-Cloud & HPC Support:** Provides flexible deployment options across local, HPC (DRMAA), and cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) environments.
*   **Extensible Plugin Architecture:** Easily extend the platform's capabilities by developing custom plugins for new tools and analyses.
*   **Interactive Reporting:** Generates detailed, interactive reports and visualizations using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Bokeh.
