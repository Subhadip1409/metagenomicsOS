        I'm trying to run a comparative analysis between two sample groups, but I'm not sure:
        1. How to structure my metadata file
        2. Which analysis parameters to use
        3. How to interpret the statistical output

        I have 20 samples from two treatment groups (10 controls, 10 treated).
        I want to find differentially abundant taxa between groups.
        I've successfully run QC and taxonomic classification, but I'm stuck on the comparative analysis step.
