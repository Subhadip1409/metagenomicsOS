      description: Describe your ideal solution in detail
      placeholder: |
        I propose adding a `temporal-analysis` module that would:
        1. Accept time-series sample metadata
        2. Track taxonomic changes over time
        3. Generate time-series visualizations
        4. Export results in standard formats

      description: Describe how a user would interact with this feature
      placeholder: |
        As a researcher studying gut microbiome dynamics:
        1. I would run: `metagenomicsOS temporal --input samples/ --metadata timeline.csv`
        2. The system would detect temporal relationships in my data
        3. I would receive interactive plots and statistical summaries
        4. I could export results for publication
